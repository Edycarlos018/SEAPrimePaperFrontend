Prime Paper is a Brazilian paper distributor owned and run by
Edson's family. This website allows them to easily add new 
paper products that customers can then add to their cart. In
the future, purchasing paper directly through this website will
be possible, although it was out of scope for the time-frame website
were given.

The Prime Paper website has two parts - the front end, which uses
Angular, and the back end, which uses .NET Core.

To add, edit, or delete products, you must be logged in as an admin.
To add or remove items from your cart, you must be logged in as a user.
When not logged in, all you can do is view the products.

Our website features a log-out function, support for adding and removing
contact information including address phone number etc., and an about
page with an embeded video. All in all, we used 3 tables for this project.

Future goals include adding purchase support whether over the phone/email
or via direct purchasing using Stripe, a live support chat, transaction
history, and a monthly newsletter.
