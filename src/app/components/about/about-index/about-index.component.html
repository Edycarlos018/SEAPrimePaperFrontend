  Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or
  grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing,
  printing, packaging, cleaning, decorating, and a number of industrial and construction processes. Papers are
  essential in legal or non-legal documentation.

  The pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in China during the early 2nd century CE, possibly as
  early as the year 105 CE, by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun, although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper
  derive from the 2nd century BCE in China. The modern pulp and paper industry is global, with China leading its
  production and the United States right behind it.
